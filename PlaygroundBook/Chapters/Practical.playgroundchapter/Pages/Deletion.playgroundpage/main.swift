# Deletion with CRISPR
### Come up with something here

 Sometimes, we don't want to change a gene, but rather get rid of it entirely. The McIntosh apple on the right has purple spots all over this. However, recent market research shows that consumers do not like them. Let's use CRISPR to get rid of them.
 
 To delete genes, scientists use CRISPR to cut out the targeted gene, but don't supply a template sequence. The DNA then uses Non Homologous repair, which is an error prone process that attempts to reconstruct the strand. In the process, the gene is effectively deleted.
 
 The three base "codon" that codes for the apple's spots is AAG
 
*/

//: First,let's attach the CRISPR protein to our DNA strand
attachToDNA()

//: Second, let's configure the target DNA that we want to remove (AAG)
configureTarget(target: /*#-editable-code Sequence*/""/*#-end-editable-code*/)

//: Now, we're ready to start editing. Run your code, then tap the play button on the top right of the editor screen. The DNA will automatically try homology directed repair.
