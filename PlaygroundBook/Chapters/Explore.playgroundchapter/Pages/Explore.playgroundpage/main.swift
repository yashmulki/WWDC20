 # Introduction to CRISPR
 ### DNA, Genes and Modification
 
 DNA is the language of life. Much like computer code, which can be compiled into a program, every organism's unique genetic code, encoded in the DNA within its cells, defines it's structure and characteristics. For example, your eye color üëÅÔ∏è is largely determined by your OCA2 and HERC2 genes. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the form in which genes are stored.
 
 DNA has 4 building blocks: C,G,A and T, which are the "bases" that DNA is made of. Like how 0 and 1 form the basis of computers, these bases are the foundations of genetic code and can be combined in many unique sequences. DNA is double stranded, which means it has two concurrent strands. If the top strand base is A, the bottom must be T. The same goes for C and G, G and C, and T and A. These bases form "base pairs"
 
 CRISPR/Cas-9 represents a revolutionary new advance in our ability to harness the power of DNA and modify genetic sequences. The CRISPR system, originally discovered in bacteria, which use it to defend against attacks by bacteriophages, has been modified by scientists to modify cells of organisms, including humans and other mammals. The Cas-9 protein (shown on the right) can find a certain genetic sequence in a DNA strand and cut it out.
