 # Introduction to CRISPR
 ### DNA, Genes and Modification
 
 DNA is the language of life. Every organism's unique genetic code, encoded in the DNA within its cells, defines it's structure and characteristics. For example, your eye color üëÅÔ∏è is largely determined by your OCA2 and HERC2 genes.
 
 DNA has 4 building blocks: C,G,A and T, which are the "bases" that DNA is made of. These bases are the foundations of genetic code and can be combined in many unique sequences. DNA is double stranded, which means it has two concurrent strands.
 
 CRISPR/Cas-9 represents a revolutionary new advance in our ability to harness the power of DNA and modify genetic sequences. The Cas-9 protein (shown on the right) can find a certain genetic sequence in a DNA strand and cut it out.
